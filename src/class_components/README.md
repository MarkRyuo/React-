- Class Components are the original way to build components in React — before hooks even existed.
They use the class keyword and extend React.Component. Inside them, you manage state using this.state and update it with this.setState().


- Characteristics:
    - Uses class syntax
    - Has a render() method
    - Uses this.state for data
    - Uses this.props to access props
    - Uses this.setState() to update data
    - Can use lifecycle methods (like componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, etc.)


Era:
Dominated React from 2013–2018, before React Hooks were introduced.
