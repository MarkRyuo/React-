- These are just JavaScript functions that return JSX.
Originally, they were stateless — but since React v16.8 (2019) introduced Hooks, they became fully capable of managing state, effects, and context.

- Characteristics:
    - Uses functions instead of classes
    - Uses Hooks (like useState, useEffect, etc.)
    - Simpler and cleaner syntax
    - No need for this
    - Easier to read, test, and reuse logic

- Era:
Dominates modern React (2019–present).
Almost all new React codebases use this style.
